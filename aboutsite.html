<h1>ABOUT MY PERSONAL SITE</h1>
    <br>
    <b>
WEB DEVELOPMENT always seemed interesting to me and due to which I explored many places and site and decided to make my first personal site via html<br>
I checked on many videos for learning the basics and I am feeling glad that I was able to accomplish my this task via html.<br>
In future after learning CSS and JAVASCRIPT,I aim to try new things and explore various features in the feild of WEB DEVELOPMENT.
