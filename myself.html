As you guys already know my name, let me tell you guys something about me.<br>
I am from Moradabad,a beautiful small city in Uttar Pradesh.<br>
Moradabad is famous for brass work and their are some places nearby to visit and have fun on weekends.
The most common places include Prem Wonder Land and Holiday Regency.<br>Other than that their are many cafeterias near MDA site which are famous for various delacies.<br>
Being the youngest member of my family of four I love listening songs and reading novels.Not just that I enjoy dancing and painting in my free time.<br>
This is my first site which I made and honestly I liked sharing a few elements of my life with you all.
