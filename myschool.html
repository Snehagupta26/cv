<h1>EDUCATION</h1>
<p><h3>I did my schooling from <a href = "https://www.stmarysmrd.in/"> ST.MARY SENIOR SECONDARY SCHOOL</a>,MORADABAD.
St.Mary's is a Christian girls school and one of the most famous schools in Moradabad.<br>
The school is not just big and beautiful but also has excellent staff and faculty members who support the students and help them in making their future brighter.<br>
